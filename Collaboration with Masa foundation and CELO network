Prosperity Pass’s development stems from a long-standing partnership between Masa Finance and the Celo Foundation, dating back to 2021 when Masa won the grand prize in Celo Camp Batch 4. Masa’s expertise in SBTs has been instrumental in creating a user-friendly, scalable identity solution. According to Calanthia Mei, co-founder of Masa, SBTs are a “composable and scalable way to build a trust layer” for Web3, enabling practical use cases like micro-loans and reputation scores.

The Celo Foundation’s Strategy & Innovation team has played a key role in integrating Prosperity Pass into the ecosystem, ensuring alignment with Celo’s mission of financial inclusion and sustainability. Isha Varshney, Head of DeFi at the Celo Foundation, emphasized that SBTs enhance user engagement and usability, particularly for ReFi activities.
