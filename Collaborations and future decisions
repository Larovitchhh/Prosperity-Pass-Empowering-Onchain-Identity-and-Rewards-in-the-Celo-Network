Despite its success, Prosperity Pass faces challenges, such as ensuring broad adoption among traditional users unfamiliar with Web3. The complexity of SBTs and onchain identity may require further education and onboarding efforts, which CeloPG is addressing through community initiatives and resources like the Celo Public Goods Hub (celopg.eco).

Looking ahead, Prosperity Pass aims to expand its utility by:Scaling ReFi Integration: Enhancing the ReFi DAO Badge system to reward more contributions to climate and social impact projects.

Developer Support: Encouraging Celo developers to build on Masa’s SBT protocol, creating new use cases for Prosperity Pass in DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi.

Global Reach: Leveraging Celo’s mobile-first design to onboard the next billion users, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional financial systems.

The beta launch of Prosperity Pass at pass.celopg.eco marks a significant milestone, with plans to refine the platform based on user feedback and ecosystem growth.
