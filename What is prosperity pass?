What is Prosperity Pass?Prosperity Pass is a Celo-native ecosystem account that consolidates users’ onchain activities into a single, user-friendly smart account wallet. Introduced in beta by CeloPG, it builds on the infrastructure of Super Accounts and leverages Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), non-transferable tokens that represent a user’s identity, contributions, and reputation within the Celo ecosystem. Unlike traditional NFTs, SBTs are tied to a user’s wallet and cannot be traded, making them ideal for building trust and authenticity in Web3.

Developed in collaboration with the Celo Foundation and Masa Finance, Prosperity Pass—initially launched as Prosperity Passport in March 2023—enables users to mint SBTs for various purposes, such as user authentication, credit scores, community reputation, and unique .celo domain names. This solution empowers over 10 million Celo wallets to access onchain tools, real-world utilities, and rewards, fostering deeper engagement with Celo’s mission-driven ecosystem.
