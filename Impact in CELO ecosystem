Prosperity Pass is a cornerstone of Celo’s vision to create a regenerative digital economy that fosters prosperity for all. By providing a scalable, trust-based identity solution, it addresses Web3’s “trust issue” and bridges onchain and offchain activities. Since its launch, the initiative has seen significant traction:Mass Adoption: Masa Finance reported nearly 250,000 Soulbound Identities and 300,000 .Soul Names minted, with over 100,000 global community members participating.

Ecosystem Engagement: Prosperity Pass enhances user interaction with Celo’s diverse projects, including DeFi platforms, ReFi initiatives, and social impact solutions, by offering rewards and recognition for contributions.

Support for CeloPG Initiatives: As part of Celo Public Goods, Prosperity Pass aligns with programs like CeloRPGF0 and the Celo Citizen Retro, which reward impactful contributions to the ecosystem. For example, the Celo Citizen Retro program, running until December 20, 2024, celebrates individual efforts that advance Celo’s mission.

The initiative also supports Celo’s transition to an Ethereum Layer 2 chain using Optimism’s OP Stack, enhancing scalability and interoperability while maintaining low-cost transactions. This makes Prosperity Pass an ideal tool for global users, particularly in emerging markets where Celo’s stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL) provide practical financial solutions.
